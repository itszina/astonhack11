# Canopy
Canopy is a mobile productivity application developed as an interactive prototype designed to help students improve concentration during study or lecture sessions. 
The app combines focus tracking with gamification by allowing users to grow a virtual tree based on their attention levels. 
The project demonstrates how simple tracking mechanics and a lightweight mobile stack can create a motivating and engaging study experience.

## App Overview

Users start a focus session while studying or attending lectures. 
The application tracks focus time, calculates a focus percentage, and visually represents progress through tree growth. 
Additional tools such as note-taking, lecture transcription, and performance analytics help support learning and productivity.


## Core Features

### Focus Sessions

Start timed study or lecture sessions.
Focus is measured throughout the session and converted into a percentage score.
Tree growth visually reflects user concentration levels.
Tree stops growing if focus drops.

### Gamification System

Virtual tree grows as focus improves.
Focus percentage affects tree growth stage.
Session statistics contribute toward achievements and milestones.
Daily streak tracking encourages consistent productivity.

### Dashboard Analytics

Displays focus history and session performance.
Graph shows focus improvement trends over time.
Session history allows users to review previous performance.

### Notes & AI Summary

Users can create and edit study notes.
Mock AI summary feature generates simplified lecture summaries.
Notes support structured learning and review.

### Lecture Mode

Microphone recording captures lecture sessions.
Simulated live transcription displays lecture text in real time.
Transcripts are saved locally for later revision.

### Profile & Achievements

Tracks total sessions completed.
Calculates average focus percentage.
Unlockable achievements reward user progress and consistency.

Gamification Concept

The tree growth mechanic encourages deep focus by visually rewarding attention:

- 🌱 Low Focus → Small Seedling
- 🌿 Moderate Focus → Growing Plant
- 🌳 Strong Focus → Mature Tree
- 🌲 High Focus → Full Growth Tree

Loss of focus slows or stops growth, reinforcing consistent attention.
