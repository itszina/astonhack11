# Octo-Bounce

Octo-Bounce is a browser-based mini-game developed as an interactive prototype for **Majestic** and **Untold Studios** during AstonHack11. The project demonstrates how simple game mechanics and a lightweight technical stack can be used to create an interactive experience within a web browser.
The player controls an octopus and must reach the ocean surface by spawning bubbles and interacting with in-game elements such as jellyfish. The game includes basic physics, collision detection, and a simple user interface to communicate game state and progress.
